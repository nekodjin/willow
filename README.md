# Willow: A ??? UI Framework
TODO: find a word to describe Willow (replace ???)

This is a WIP. Like, this is _really_ a WIP.

The contents of this repository are subject to rapid change and/or deletion.
Nothing is constant. You should not expect any promises made herein to come to
fruition. You should not expect any claims made herein to be representative of

LICENSING: This work is proprietary - all rights reserved. Derivative works
are not permitted in any capacity without explicit permission from myself.
This is not because I don't believe in (F)OSS, but rather because I don't want
to make a licensing decision I'll regret later, nor do I want to spend time
bikeshedding on which license to use. If you want to create a derivative work
of any kind, just reach out to me - as long as you're cool, I can almost
guarantee I'll give you my enthusiastic consent. If this project ever becomes
something serious, it will be (F)OSS-licensed before the first stable release.
